# BlackJack-2017
This is the first "big" project I made completely individually. I started learning programming and Java in Fall of 2017, and I made this project
after a few months later.  

## Overview
Originally built in Netbeans IDE, I made it IntelliJ IDE compatible recently. 

The project is a standard Blackjack game.
 * See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack for rules.
 * In this version, the Dealer will stand on 17, but the Dealer will **_ALWAYS_** win ties. 
 * A "blackjack" will pay the player 3 to 2.
 * The dealing shoe contains 8 decks of standard playing cards.
 * Player will start at $100 and can choose to bet whichever integer amount he/she pleases. 
 * If the user decides to leave, or if the player runs out of money, the game will end.
 * GLHF!
